# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

## Research Question 
Can we analyze customer sentiments from the reviews using neural networks and NLP techniques so that our company can take appropriate actions to address any issues?

## The goal of the data analysis
The objective is to predict how a user feels about a product based on their word choices. By using this sentiment analysis based on past reviews, we can predict customer sentiment so the company can take appropriate actions for maximum customer satisfaction. We can also use a successful model to evaluate customer sentiment and make recommendations.

## Identify a type of neural network capable of performing a text classification task and producing useful predictions
Artificial neural networks, designed with biological neural network inspiration, can comprehend unstructured data and make general observations without explicit training.

Recurrent neural Networks (RNN) are a class of artificial neural networks where the output of recurrent neural networks depends on the previous elements within the sequence. RNN leverage backpropagation which aids the network to learn continuously by using corrective feedback loops to improve their predictive analytics. Simply there is one correct path to the output. To find this path neural network uses a feedback loop, checking each node's guess about the next node, assigning weight values according to correct/incorrect guesses, making new predictions using the higher weight paths, then repeating the process.

RNN algorithms are commonly used in language translation, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and image captioning. Some examples of applications that incorporate RNN are Siri and Google Translate.
